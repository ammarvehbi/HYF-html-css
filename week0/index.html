      <h4 class="current">Current Situation</h4>
    <p id="current_situation_text">There has been a marked acceleration in global warming since the mid-20th century with an average temperature increase of 1°C between 1961 and 2016 (measures against the pre-industrial period which serves as a reference). The effects are clearly visible, one of the most remarkable being the sea level rise as the thermal expansion of water due to this increased warming causes this water to take up more and more of the ocean’s surface. The melting of the ice caps also contributes to this sea level rise, and the gradual retreat of the summer Arctic sea ice is a further indication of global warming.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="cause">
      <p id="cause_head"></p>  
    <br>
    <h4 class="cause">Cause</h4>
    <p id="cause_text">Our energy system is based on solar energy. The Earth absorbs heat and emits thermal radiation into the atmosphere. Half of the solar radiation is captured by the surface of the Earth. Surface temperature, therefore, increases and produces heat radiation, of which 90% is absorbed into the atmosphere. The atmosphere then reheats and feeds back into the heat absorbed by the surface of the earth. But greenhouse gases trap thermal radiation close to the surface of the Earth, as the atmosphere is essentially open to solar radiation but not thermal radiation.
      <br><br>The heat-trapping ability of CO2
<br><br>Steam (H2O) has the highest overall warming effect, but this is without the direct influence of humans who do, however, contribute to the carbon emissions (CO2) currently representing a third of those from steam.  From a physics perspective, it is interesting to note that the spectrum of CO2 is such that absorption occurs even in the absence of steam. This gas, therefore, has a significant effect. CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas. The measurements taken at various intervals show in particular that atmosphere’s CO2 quantity has increased dramatically over the last five decades, from 320 parts per million in 1960 to over 400 today (up 20%). Looking back, by thousands of years, we see that human life has never been exposed to such a high concentration of CO2 as it is today. The situation we are in today is unprecedented.

<br><br>Alongside the changes in the atmosphere’s CO2 concentration, changes have been observed in temperatures over the various ice ages. 

<br><br>We even see a correlation between the two. It is this very fact that has led many to conclude that in light of the last few thousand years these changes are a natural occurrence linked to changes in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun and amplified by CO2 and CH4 (methane) emissions. In these conditions, temperature increases ten times faster which is too unusual. 

      <br><br>Added to natural factors are human factors: industrial pollution, modification of terrain due to exploitation and certain farming practices.  Computer modeling of accelerated warming between 1860 and 2000 gives a clearer picture by comparing a scenario accounting for natural factors (sun, volcanoes) with a scenario accounting for all factors, including greenhouse gas.  

<br><br>Yet global warming is not uniform and varies significantly across the globe. Looking at the planisphere established for the period 1901-2012, we see that global warming appears to affect first and foremost the continental regions, whereas there is almost no increase in temperature in the North Atlantic area. Climate experts are grappling to explain this phenomenon, which could be to do with the ocean’s internal circulation in this part of the world. Sharp temperature increases of more than two degrees have been observed as localized to continental Asia and South America.

  <p>Evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be used to reconstruct past climates. Reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 19th century. For earlier periods, most of the evidence is indirect—climatic changes are inferred from changes in proxies, indicators that reflect climate, such as vegetation, ice cores, dendrochronology, sea level change, and glacial geology.

    <br><br><strong>Temperature (surface and oceans)</strong>
<br>The instrumental temperature record from surface stations was supplemented by radiosonde balloons, extensive atmospheric monitoring by the mid-20th century, and, from the 1970s on, with global satellite data as well. Taking the record as a whole, most of the 20th century had been unprecedentedly warm, while the 19th and 17th centuries were quite cool.

<br><br>The 18O/16O ratio in calcite and ice core samples used to deduce ocean temperature in the distant past is an example of a temperature proxy method, as are other climate metrics noted in subsequent categories.

    <br><br><strong>Glaciers</strong>
<br>Glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change. Their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output. As temperatures warm, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt; the converse is also true.

<br><br>Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation, and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season. Therefore, one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate.

<br><br>A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s, initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites. This compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000 km2, and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000 km2. The World Glacier Monitoring Service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance. From this data, glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly, with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s, stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s, and again retreating from the mid-1980s to the present.

<br><br>The most significant climate processes since the middle to late Pliocene (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and interglacial cycles. The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has lasted about 11,700 years. Shaped by orbital variations, responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including Heinrich events, Dansgaard–Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas, however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing.

<br><br>Glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material—including organic matter, quartz, and potassium that may be dated—recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated. Similarly, by tephrochronological techniques, the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained.

<br><br>Data from NASA's Grace satellites show that the land ice sheets in both Antarctica and Greenland have been losing mass since 2002. Both ice sheets have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009.

<br><br><strong>Arctic sea ice decline</strong>
<br>The decline in Arctic sea ice, both in extent and thickness, over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change. Sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface. It covers millions of square kilometers in the polar regions, varying with the seasons. In the Arctic, some sea ice remains year after year, whereas almost all Southern Ocean or Antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually. Satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.2 percent per decade, relative to the 1981 to 2010 average. The 2007 Arctic summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented. Decades of shrinking and thinning in a warm climate has put the Arctic sea ice in a precarious position, it is now vulnerable to atmospheric anomalies. "Both extent and volume anomaly fluctuate little from January to July and then decrease steeply in August and September". This decrease is because of lessened ice production as a result of the unusually high SAT. During the Arctic summer, a slower rate of sea ice production is the same as a faster rate of sea ice melting.</p>

    <h4 class="what_we_can_do">What We<br>Can Do</h4>
    <p id="what_can_we_do_text">The necessary development of alternative sources of energy. To predict what our future will look like we will need to think about CO2 and, by extension, the future of our economic models and the way we use energy. We can start by drawing up scenarios on CO2 concentration and emissions, keeping in mind that we cannot use the same time and quantity reasoning for these two different elements. Reducing emissions will not guarantee, in the short run, a return to an acceptable concentration level. As for warming forecasts, the results range from 1° to 5° in the space of a century. But one thing is sure: to stop global warming we will need to stop CO2 emissions, and not just make promises to reduce them. Only, it will be difficult to stop CO2 emissions altogether. We can hope that new technologies will enable us to capture and store CO2 in the atmosphere.

<br><br>Scenarios on future temperatures and rainfall have also been drawn up. It is very difficult to obtain detailed models on expectant rainfall. 
     
     <br><br>Existing models nevertheless suggest that certain regions will soon become wetter, while the Mediterranean and North African area will be far arider. We already have an idea of what impact greenhouse gas emissions will have by 2100, and the news is not good: two billion people are expected to face water shortages; 10 to 12 billion people are expected to face heatwaves every year, and 70 to 90 million people are expected to be affected by flooding every year. All these scenarios spell disaster. 

<br><br>While there was much enthusiasm around the Paris Agreement and the principle of countries committing to reducing their gas emissions is encouraging, the COP 21 target falls short of the real objective. But we absolutely have to reach the 1.5° target. Developing recyclable and renewable energies has, therefore, become an imperative. To date, 21 countries have committed to doubling their investments in green energy.

<br><br>On 1 June, US President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. He first spoke about renegotiating it, revealing a profound ignorance of the very principle of the Agreement which is founded on the commitment of the signing countries. Yet despite this, he can decide not to apply it to the United States, which is a worrying prospect. We are all concerned by this challenge which is also linked to consumption and individual behavior. </p>
